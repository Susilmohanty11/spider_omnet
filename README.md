This is a simulator that models the flow of transactions through a payment channel network. 
To setup, first follow the omnet installation instructions from [Omnet Installation Link](https://omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/InstallGuide.pdf)
Following this, clone this repo in the `samples` directory of the omnet installation.

Then, run the following commands:
```cd samples/spider_omnet/
make
omnetpp```

This should open the Omnet IDE and you can click on the `simpleNet.ned` file and run the OmnetSimulation from there.

TODO: how to run experiments and how to plot/view graphs.
